I obtained my Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Western Australia (UWA). My research focused on individual differences in face processing (face detection, face perceptual discrimination, face memory, and expression recognition), cognitive abilities (intelligence), and autistic-like traits in neurotypical adults. I have a passion for research into face perception and this has led me to join Lingnan University as a Postdoctoral Fellow in January 2024, as part of the Visual Cognition Lab under the supervision of Prof. Will Hayward. We are investigating the development of face familiarity incorporating behavioural methods, EEG/ERP, and eye-tracking. I am also assisting with the other research projects within the Visual Cognition Lab.

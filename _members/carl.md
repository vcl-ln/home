Successful performance in a visual search task requires deploying an effective selection mechanism. My long-term research objective is to develop a theoretically and neurobiologically grounded understanding of the human visual system's functions and limitations in overcoming perceptual challenges. To achieve this, I employ multimodal cognitive neuroscientific approaches, including computational models, eye-tracking, and pupillometry, and plan to expand my research by incorporating other neuroimaging techniques, such as EEG and fMRI. Other than that, I also enjoy collaborating with researchers in different areas to resolve practical problems using various statistical methods and modeling.

I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from the Department of Psychology at HKU. My work was focused on individual differences in eye movements during face perception, combining behavioral methods and EEG. Beyond face perception, Iâ€™m interested in visual perception and perceptual decision-making.
